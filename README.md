# Description

This is auto-install .config for **Fedora 41** with Hyprland (Wayland), Waybar, and additional utilities for enhanced desktop experience.

# Install Guide

1. Download actual version of [**Fedora Server Network Install iso**](https://fedoraproject.org/server/download)

2. Create a bootable USB drive by, for example, **dd** comand (Linux) or [**Rufus**](https://rufus.ie/) (Windows)

3. Using your USB, install Fedora Workstation only with network drives (u maybe must use anaconda repo (https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs))

4. After completing the system installation, log in with TTY and install git package by:
```bash
sudo dnf install git -y
```

5. Next, you download this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CrispusCrew/.config.git
```

6. And start bash script
```bash
cd .config
sudo chmod +x config_auto.sh
sudo ./config_auto.sh
```

7. You must install your GPU drivers by yourself, otherwise wayland-session may crash. If u have nvidia GPU, in my expirience, best way to get it - by RPM Fusion. For it:
```bash
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia
sudo reboot
```

8. Reboot your pc/laptop. Log in by TTY (press Ctrl+Alt+F2 if necessary), and write
```bash
Hyprland
```

# Enjoy
Your system is now configured with Hyprland and customized utilities. Explore and enjoy your beautiful new Linux desktop experience!
